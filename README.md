The program is designed for watering plants
We leave on vacation, and the flowers are left alone at home.
A simple system was needed to remotely water the plants.
Here's what we put together:
1) Smart remote from Yandex
2) infrared receiver and Arduino
3) a bottle of water
4) solenoid valves 4 pieces
5) electromagnetic relay 4 pieces
6) silicone tube 4mm inner diameter
